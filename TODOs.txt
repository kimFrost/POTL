17.2.17: 
 x Make solution work with 4.14
 x Fix BP_Hexdecal broken

x.2.17
 x Refactor FST_Hex to be Uobject instead UHex class
 x Refactor decal system to be decal per hex 
 
27.2.17
 x UProductionComponent Production on time update if on
 x StorageMap

 x Make resource unique uobjects instead of just number in a list
 x UStorageComponent store resource as UResource instead of int
 x UProductionComponent produces UResource instead of just string with quantity
 x Make UStorageMap OnStorageUpdate broadcast updated UStorageComponent and UResource

4.3.17
 x Resource transfer / Transaction between dwellings (Option for resource consume on transaction with success callback)
 
8.3.17
 x Structure placeholder init on place to trigger init on child components
 x Clean/Remove old code and clean structure json data
 x New Plant structure logic for player controller
 - New structure placement validation logic

Backlog -----------------------------
 - Request resource with wealth budget parameter
 - Storage visualization
 - Transaction visualization
 - Get logic out of HUD_Map
 - Dwelling request food
 - Search StorageMap for resource from location
 - StorageMap - RequestResouce - Sort Storages by distance to requester
 - Dwelling Labor Points & Types

Temp Notes ----------------------

255 (1020)
294.4486 (1177.7945) => 294 (1176)

R = 255 / 1.7 = 150 == 147

!!RequestResource function only return a pointer to a avaiable resource. It does not consume or transfer the resource!!


// Transaction result benifit types?
	- Wealth
	- Happiness
	- Nothing
	- 


UProductionComponent call Request resource on game instance to get a pointer to a resource of type.
Then UProductionComponent call TransferResource on game instance with parameter for consume and/or free transaction
	- TransferResource() - will call resource->Transfer and update all storages associated with the resource



Transaction call on what? GameInstance? Between structures? Storages? Components? StorageMap?


Transfer to UStorageComponent or UStructureComponent or Structure


Transfer resource from one storage to anotger. Storage bind to resource event "stored" ?
