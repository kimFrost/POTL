17.2.17: 
 x Make solution work with 4.14
 x Fix BP_Hexdecal broken

x.2.17
 x Refactor FST_Hex to be Uobject instead UHex class
 x Refactor decal system to be decal per hex 
 
27.2.17
 x UProductionComponent Production on time update if on
 x StorageMap

1.3.17
 x Structure addResource. Distribute to storage in self first, and then to attachments
 x Make resource unique uobjects instead of just number in a list
 x UStorageComponent store resource as UResource instead of int
 x UProductionComponent produces UResource instead of just string with quantity
 x Make UStorageMap OnStorageUpdate broadcast updated UStorageComponent and UResource

4.3.17
 x Resource transfer / Transaction between dwellings (Option for resource consume on transaction with success callback)
 
8.3.17
 x Structure placeholder init on place to trigger init on child components
 x Clean/Remove old code and clean structure json data
 x New Plant structure logic for player controller
 - New structure placement validation logic
 
10.3.17 
 x Request resource by tag
 x StructureComponent - Production loop & bIsWorking
 
11.3.17

 
Backlog -----------------------------
 - Include in storage for UStructureComponent doens't allow for trigger tranfer event on storagemap. Need a better solution. But it might trigger a transaction event.
 - UStructureComponent doesn't transfer resources.
 - Request resource with wealth budget parameter
 - Storage visualization
 - Transaction visualization
 - Get logic out of HUD_Map
 - Dwelling request food
 - Search StorageMap for resource from location
 - StorageMap - RequestResouce - Sort Storages by distance to requester
 - Dwelling Labor Points & Types
 - Dwelling attachment points. In data ?


 
 
 
 
Ideas ----------------------
 - "GravhÃ¸j" - Early first stage of religion. Simple way of dealing with "death" debuff. The specialty of religion. Will alway provide religion in range. 
 - Dwelling will "construct" structures attached to them.
 - Store resource in structure construction component and lock them. It means that construction site can be place without having all resources at the beginning of construction
 - Construction cost is taking over time. Like space engineers
 - A workshop attached to a dwelling will provide build points in area/range
 - Well -> Provide water in range/area
 - "The Rot". Plague sweaps the land.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Temp Notes ----------------------

255 (1020) / 2 = 127.5
294.4486 (1177.7945) => 294 (1176) / 4 = 73.5

R = 255 / 1.7 = 150 == 147

!!RequestResource function only return a pointer to a avaiable resource. It does not consume or transfer the resource!!


// Transaction result benifit types?
	- Wealth
	- Happiness
	- Nothing
	- 


UProductionComponent call Request resource on game instance to get a pointer to a resource of type.
Then UProductionComponent call TransferResource on game instance with parameter for consume and/or free transaction
	- TransferResource() - will call resource->Transfer and update all storages associated with the resource



Transaction call on what? GameInstance? Between structures? Storages? Components? StorageMap?


Transfer to UStorageComponent or UStructureComponent or Structure


Transfer resource from one storage to anotger. Storage bind to resource event "stored" ?


UPOTLGameInstance
	- UStorageMap

UProduction 
	- Request Resource on StorageMap
	- Storage Map search storages for resource of quantity (Only single unit at a time?)

	
- In / Out Production
- Storage / Vendor




Single Resource Unit per UResource
