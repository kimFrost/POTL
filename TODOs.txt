17.2.17: 
 - Make solution work with 4.14
 - Fix BP_Hexdecal broken

x.2.17
 - Refactor FST_Hex to be Uobject instead UHex class
 - Refactor decal system to be decal per hex 
 
27.2.17
 - UProductionComponent Production on time update if on
 - StorageMap

1.3.17
 - Structure addResource. Distribute to storage in self first, and then to attachments
 - Make resource unique uobjects instead of just number in a list
 - UStorageComponent store resource as UResource instead of int
 - UProductionComponent produces UResource instead of just string with quantity
 - Make UStorageMap OnStorageUpdate broadcast updated UStorageComponent and UResource

4.3.17
 - Resource transfer / Transaction between dwellings (Option for resource consume on transaction with success callback)
 
 
Backlog -----------------------------
 - Search StorageMap for resource from location
 - StorageMap - RequestResouce - Sort Storages by distance to requester
 - Visualize StorageMap
 - Dwelling Labor Points & Types
 - Dwelling attachment points. In data ?

Temp Notes ----------------------

!!RequestResource function only return a pointer to a avaiable resource. It does not consume or transfer the resource!!


Transaction call on what? GameInstance? Between structures? Storages? Components? StorageMap?


Transfer to UStorageComponent or UStructureComponent or Structure


Transfer resource from one storage to anotger. Storage bind to resource event "stored" ?
