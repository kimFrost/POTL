17.2.17: 
 - Make solution work with 4.14
 - Fix BP_Hexdecal broken

x.2.17
 - Refactor FST_Hex to be Uobject instead UHex class
 - Refactor decal system to be decal per hex 
 
27.2.17
 - UProductionComponent Production on time update if on
 - StorageMap

1.3.17
 - Structure addResource. Distribute to storage in self first, and then to attachments
 - Make resource unique uobjects instead of just number in a list
 - UStorageComponent store resource as UResource instead of int
 - UProductionComponent produces UResource instead of just string with quantity
 - Make UStorageMap OnStorageUpdate broadcast updated UStorageComponent and UResource

 
 

 
Backlog -----------------------------
 - Search StorageMap for resource from location
 - StorageMap - RequestResouce - Sort Storages by distance to requester
 - Resource transfer / Transaction between dwellings (Option for resource consume on transaction with success callback)
 - Visualize StorageMap
 - Dwelling Labor Points & Types
 - Dwelling attachment points. In data ?

Temp Notes ----------------------

!!RequestResource function only return a pointer to a avaiable resource. It does not consume or transfer the resource!!
